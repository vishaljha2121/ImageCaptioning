## About The Project


This is an image captioning deep learning model, which returns a single line description of the image fed to it.


### Built With

* **Encoder-Decoder architecture**.
* **Transfer Learning**
* **Beam Search**.
* **Flicker8k dataset**, used this dataset as was most feasible due to its smaller size comparing to COCOMO dataset.

The loss value of **4.8987** has been achieved which gives okayish results.
Everything is implemented in the Jupyter notebook which will hopefully make it easier to understand the code.
